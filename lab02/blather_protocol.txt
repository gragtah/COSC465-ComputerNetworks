/**
  BLATHER protocol messages can either be REQUESTS or RESPONSES

  Requests:
    There are two valid requests: PUTBLAT and GETBLAT.

    PUTBLAT is used for posting a BLAT to the blatserver.
    The format of a PUTBLAT message is as follows:
        char request[7];  // contents: PUTBLAT
        char blatter[10]; // contents: name of the blatter (e.g., @itsme!)
        char blat[50];    // contents: the blat text.

        NB: no fields should be NULL-terminated.  The blat text should be
        filled with spaces for "unused" characters.  E.g., if you send a
        blat with the text "Mmmmmm.... #mehungry", which consists of exactly
        20 characters, the remaining 30 characters in the blat text should be
        spaces.
        
        As shown above, the PUTBLAT message should be exactly 67 characters/bytes.

    GETBLAT is the other valid request.   This request is used to retrieve
        the most recent blats (up to the most recent 10).
     
    The format of a GETBLAT message is as follows:
        char request[7];   // contents: GETBLAT

        As shown above, the GETBLAT message should be exactly 7 characters.
        
  Responses:
    There are two valid responses to each of the two possible requests (making
    a total of 4 possible response messages).

    Responses for PUTBLAT:
        Success: if the PUTBLAT request is successful, 2 characters with the
                 text OK will be returned.
        Failure: if the PUTBLAT request was not successful for any reason, 2
                 characters with the text NO will be returned, followed by
                 up to 100 characters of explanation text.

    Responses for GETBLAT:
        Success: if the GETBLAT request was successful, a message with the following
                 format is returned:
            char response[2];   // contents: OK
            char numblats[2];   // contents: an ASCII number indicating the number of
                                // BLATs to follow ('00' through '10')
            char blatcontents[10*60]; 
                                // each blat is 60 bytes long: the first 10 bytes
                                // consist of the blatter name, and the remaining
                                // 50 bytes are the blat text.  If the numblats field
                                // contains " 5" (or "05"), there will be 5 blats, each of
                                // 60 bytes, in the blatcontents portion of the message.
                                // The maximum message length for a successful response
                                // to GETBLAT can be up to 2+2+10*60 bytes.
                                // However, the message may be shorter, depending on
                                // the number of actual blats in the response.
                                // For example, if only 3 blats are returned, the response
                                // length will be 2+2+3*60.

        Failure: if the GETBLAT request is not success for any reason, a message 
                 with the text NO will be returned, followed by up to 100 characters
                 with explanation text for why the request was unsuccessful.

  If an unknown request message is received by the server, the server will response
  with the characters (2 bytes) 'NO', followed by up to 100 characters of explanation
  text.

  The BLAT server is always located at 149.43.80.25, on UDP port 2468.
