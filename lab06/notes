cat> x.txt -> dump contents of file to std output

CLIENT SIDE ************
netcat -> dumps to some network ---

netcat cs.colgate.edu 80 < input.txt    will dump contents from std input to that connection

create tcp connection to server at cs.colgate.edu port 80

copy stdin to server connection and data on server connection to stdout until connection closes/eof on stdin


SERVER SIDE************

netcat -s 12000 

when connection is received, copy data from stdin to network 
copy data from network to stdout until netconnection goes away/eof stdin


start with server side, and do refactoring for client side.
