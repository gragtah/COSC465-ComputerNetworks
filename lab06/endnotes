Your client program can exit in one of three ways: 

(a) if the server closes the connection you should exit, 
  
(b) if you havent received data from the server for 10 seconds you should close the connection, or 


(c) if you receive an EOF on stdin. For EOF, you can simulate an end of file by typing Ctrl+D on a line by itself. In the case of an EOF, the client should wait for a short period of time until it appears that the server-side has no more data to send (for example, wait for 500 milliseconds). Note that this timeout is a bit different than the 10 second idle timeout.
