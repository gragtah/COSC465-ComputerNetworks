DISCUSSION

One of the problems we faced was the Colgate firewall, and also setting up the SSH access took some time too. Flow never really seemed to work for us for some reason, so we always used ebb instead. Some other nodes seemed to not let us through either, but we managed to get a hold of a few nodes for our purpose eventually though.
One interesting observation was that the connection from Colgate always seemed to have the worst performance - lowest in terms of throughput, higher packet loss rate etc.
The path from Colgate to Japan connection was of some interest too in that after the trans-oceanic jump from Japan to US, it was a bit circuitous - it went back and forth between Colorado and California, Canada and Nevada, and eventually from California to New York most probably through a specially laid network cable from Los Angeles to NYS. 
Also interestingly there is a router adjacent to Colgate at  172.16.2.10 for which a whois lookup was completely futile and provided no information. Secretive.
